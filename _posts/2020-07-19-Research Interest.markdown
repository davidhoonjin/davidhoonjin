<font size="5em" style="color:black;">Hi, I'm an engineer who's ultimate goal is "To Make The World a Better Place". My method to achieve this goal is to develop a system or interface that actively enhances wellbeing.<br>
Therefore, <u>I am interested in DEVELOPING AN INNOVATIVE SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS DIRECT INTERACTION BETWEEN HUMAN(BRAIN) AND COMPUTER through sensing and interacting with inner and outer activity of the body.</u><br> I'm studying Electronic Engineering and Biomedical Engineering to search for the technology that best fits to human being.</font>
