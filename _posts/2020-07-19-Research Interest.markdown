BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACE(BMI) and HUMAN MACHINE INTERFACE (using MACHINE LEARNING).<br></font>
<font size="5em">
 When I read "The Giving Tree" by Shel Silverstein, I thought 'If I can build a "tree" that can interact with a human being and give benefit to them, it will be the whole village that can be happy, not just a "boy".' Ever since, I was certain that it is a machine that interacts with us which makes our life better. <b><u>I am interested in DEVELOPING A SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS DIRECT INTERACTION BETWEEN HUMAN(ESPECIALLY BRAIN) AND COMPUTER. With verifying user's intend and purpose to control things through machine learning technology and AI.</u></b>
