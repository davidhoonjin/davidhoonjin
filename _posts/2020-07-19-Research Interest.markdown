<font size="5em" style="color:black;">Hi, I'm an engineer who's ultimate goal is "To Make The World a Better Place". My method to achieve this goal is to develop a system that actively senses and interacts with inner and outer activity of the human body to improve user's health and wellbeing.<br>
<font size="6em" style="color:black;">Therefore, I am interested in <u>HCI, WEARABLES, UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING and MACHINE LEARNING</u></font>.<br> I'm studying Electronic Engineering and Biomedical Engineering to develop a technology that best fits to human being.</font>
